"""
Query Engine — extracts themes from user questions and produces
steering instructions that reshape every section of the report.

Flow:
  1. User submits up to 5 questions before generation
  2. QueryEngine scans for themes (wealth, career, relationship, health, timing, identity)
  3. Returns a QueryContext dict with:
     - questions (cleaned list)
     - themes (detected)
     - per-section steering blocks (injected into every prompt)
     - part_iv_instructions (for the direct Q&A section)

No API call needed — keyword-based theme detection is instant and cheap.
The steering blocks are plain English instructions appended to each section's
focus field, so the LLM naturally prioritizes the user's topics throughout.
